### MI Programming

This project offers a structured guide and index to al instructions
of Machine Interface programming 
on the AS/400, iSeries, Power System or whatever this incredible machine is called now.

Beware: MI is **NOT** assembler (as we all know, the OS is hardware independent),
but for some programming challenges MI offers flexibility, speed, and a lot of fun if you're a bit-twiddler.
