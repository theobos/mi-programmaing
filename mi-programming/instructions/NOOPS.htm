<P>
This instruction performs no function other
than to indicate a specific number
of bytes within the instruction stream that are to be skipped during
encapsulation.  It consists of
an operation code and 1 operand.  Operand 1 is an unsigned
immediate value that contains the number
of bytes between this instruction and the next instruction
to be processed.  These bytes are
skipped during the encapsulation of this program.  A value
of zero for operand 1 indicates that no
bytes are to be skipped between this instruction and the
next instruction to be processed.
<P>
If the operand 1 skip count indicates that the next instruction
to process is beyond the end of the
instruction stream,
an <I>invalid operand value range&nbsp; </I>(hex <A HREF="../exceptions/EX2A08.htm">2A08</A>) exception is signaled.
<P>
This instruction may be used to insert gaps in the instruction
stream in such a manner that allows
instructions with adjacent instruction addresses to not be
physically adjacent.
<P>
This instruction may not be branched to, and is not counted
as an instruction in the instruction stream.
<P>
The instruction may precede or follow any machine instruction
except the End instruction, and any
number of No Operation and Skip instructions may exist in succession.

When this instruction is used in an existing
program template, the following items
within the template may be adversely affected:
<UL>
<P><LI>
The actual
count of instructions may be altered to be different than the count of
instructions that is specified in the program template header.
<P><LI>
Object definitions
that reference instructions may now be out of range or may
not reference the intended instruction.
</UL>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
The actual number of bytes skipped includes the bytes containing
the instruction plus the number of
bytes specified by the skip count value.  The number of bytes skipped per
template version is as follows:
<UL>
<P><LI>
Version 0 = 4 plus the skip count value.
<P><LI>
Version 1 = 5 plus the skip count value.
</UL>
