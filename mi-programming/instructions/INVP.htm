INVP (
      relative_invocation   : unsigned binary(4) literal value which
                              specifies the relative invocation
) :   invocation pointer which references the invocation specified by

<H5><A NAME="Header_2">Description</A></H5>
<P>The <I>relative invocation</I>
is a literal value between 0 and scope-1 where
scope is the procedure's scoping level.
A value of 0 indicates
that an invocation pointer to the currently executing procedure is to
be returned.  A value of 1 indicates that an invocation pointer for
the most recent invocation of the procedure identified as the
owner of the currently executing procedure is returned.  Increasing
values for <I>relative invocation</I>
refer to the further static nesting
of the currently executing procedure, where invocation pointers
to the most recent invocations of those uplevel procedures are
returned.
<P>
The invocation pointer is only valid while the procedure invocation referenced
by it still exists.
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%"><TR><TH ALIGN="LEFT">Restriction</TH><TR><TD>
<P>The <I>relative invocation</I> must be 0.  Values greater than 0
are currently not supported.
