<P>
This exception is signaled when an instruction is canceled due to a
thread termination.  Because the thread is about to be terminated,
only an internal handler is able to monitor for this exception before
the thread is terminated.  No guarantee is given as to how far the
internal handler is able to proceed before the thread is terminated.
