<P>
An attempt was made to reference an object
<font color=blue>
or an object extension
</FONT>
that no longer exists or
part of it no longer exists.
<P>
This exception may not be signaled
for operations which refer to the value of
a pointer, but
which do not attempt to reference the data or object the pointer
addresses.  This exception can also be signaled when the space that the
pointer references is missing.
<P>In some implementations, the machine may optimize the use of
space pointers by some instuctions such that this exception is not
signaled.
<P><B>Note: </B>See
<A class="content" HREF="../EXCEPS.htm#HDREXCEPS">Exception Specifications</A>
for a list of points to keep in mind when reading the
descriptions of which instructions cause this exception.
<P><I>Instructions Causing Exception:</I>
<UL>
<P><LI>
Any instruction that references an object
<font color=blue>
or object extension
</FONT>
through a pointer
<P><LI>
Any instruction that references a pointer operand when the object and the
space containing the pointer have been destroyed.  This includes operand
basing pointers, space pointers used as operands that provide
addressability, and space pointers in templates pointed to by an operand.
