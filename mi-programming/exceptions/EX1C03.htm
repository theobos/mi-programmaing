<I>Instructions Causing Exception:</I>
<UL>
<P><LI>
This exception can be signaled during any machine operation that
causes auxiliary storage to be allocated.
The operations can include creation or extension of system
objects and extension of auxiliary
storage for machine overhead supporting the established processes in the
machine.
<P>
Any instruction which references bytes of data within a space object can
cause an automatic extension of the space if the space has the attribute
of being automatically extendible.  Therefore, this exception may be
signaled for any instruction which has an operand which references bytes
of data in a space.
