</B></TD><TD><P><I>Object Not Eligible for Operation
</I>
<P>
An attempt to reference an object was unsuccessful because the object
was not eligible for the operation requested for one of the following
reasons:
<UL>
<P><LI>
An object that cannot be duplicated was specified on a Create Duplicate
Object instruction.
<P><LI>
A data space or data space index was activated when a Suspend
instruction or a load/dump operation was attempted.
<P><LI>
An index that can contain pointers was referenced by a Suspend Object
instruction or was referenced for a load/dump operation.
<P><LI>
An attempt was made to activate a cursor that is already activated to
this process or is activated to another process.
<P><LI>
A temporary object was referenced on a Transfer Ownership instruction.
<P><LI>
A temporary object was referenced on a Transfer Primary Group
instruction.
<P><LI>
An attempt was made to replace a program through a load operation.
<P><LI>
An attempt was made to materialize cursor statistics when the cursor was
not active for this process.
<P><LI>
The receiving data space for a Copy Data Space Entries instruction is
active under more than one cursor.
<P><LI>
An attempt was made to modify (through the Modify Data Space Index
Attributes instruction) a data space index when the current attributes
of the data space index were incompatible with the attempted
modification.
<P><LI>
An attempt was made to retrieve (through the Retrieve Data Space Entry
instruction) a data space entry when the cursor position is the result
of group-by processing.
<P><LI>
An attempt was made to set a cursor (by a Set Cursor or a Retrieve
Sequential Data Space Entries instruction) in an event handler while the
cursor is waiting for a lock for another Set Cursor instruction.  This
can happen when an event is handled during a data base entry lock wait.
<P><LI>
The source or receiver cursor has had a set cursor operation or another
operation performed on it that left the cursor set to a data space entry
after the cursor was activated and before a Copy Data Space Entries
instruction was issued.
<P><LI>
An attempt was made to apply journal changes to an object for which
journaling is not supported.
<P><LI>
An attempt was made to apply journal changes to a data space that had a
cursor active over it.
<P><LI>
An attempt was made to attach a new Journal space to a remote
journal port without first attaching a matching journal space
to the local journal port associated with this remote port.
<P><LI>
An attempt was made to start journaling for an object to a journal
port which is not allowed to have objects journaled to it.
<P><LI>
An attempt was made to reset the journal entry sequence number
of the first entry on a journal space attached to a remote journal
port.
<P><LI>
An attempt was made to attach more than one journal space to a remote
journal port.
<P><LI>
An attempt was made to change the journal entry prefix lengths for
a remote journal port.
<P><LI>
An attempt was made to change the discard transient entries value for
a default or remote journal port.
<P><LI>
An attempt was made to change the prevent journal entry deposits value
for a default or remote journal port.
<P><LI>
An attempt was made to change the prevent journal entry deposits value
so as to start preventing deposits
for a journal port which is already preventing deposits.
<P><LI>
An attempt was made to change the prevent journal entry deposits value
so as to cease preventing deposits
for a journal port which has already ceased preventing deposits.
<P><LI>
An attempt was made to specify user specific data to be included in
the initial entry deposited on a journal space attached to a remote
journal port.
<P><LI>
An attempt was made to create a remote journal receiving environment
for a default journal port, or for a journal port that has more
than one journal space attached to it, or for a journal port that
is not a remote journal port.
<P><LI>
An attempt was made to add a remote journal sending environment
for a default journal port or for a journal port that has more
than one journal space attached to it.
<font color=blue>
<P><LI>
An attempt was made to begin journaling of a dataspace that supports
a maximum record length of 3.5GB to a journal port that does not
support a maximum journal entry length greater than 15MB.
</FONT>
<font color=blue>
<P><LI>
An attempt was made to journal a queue that was created with the<I>
contains pointers and scalar data</I> attribute.
<P><LI>
An attempt was made to journal a space object whose subtype is not
supported by journaling.
</FONT>
<P><LI>
An attempt was made to insert a user profile or a temporary object into
an authority list on the Modify Authority List instruction.
<P><LI>
An attempt was made to use the Modify Program instruction to compress or
decompress a part of a program object that either does exist or is
already in the requested format.
<P><LI>
An attempt was made to use the Modify Program instruction to compress a
program that either was created before version 1 release 3, or has been
modified outside of machine control.
<P><LI>
An attempt was made to use the Test System Object instruction
on an object having an object type that is not supported by the
instruction.
<P><LI>
An attempt was made to use the Test System Object instruction
on a module object or a program object that has not been converted
to version 3 release 6 format.
<P><LI>
An attempt was made to use the Set Space Pointer From Pointer instruction
to set a space pointer from a system pointer pointing to a
XOM object.
