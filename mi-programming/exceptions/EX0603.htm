A subscript value of less than 1 or greater than the number of

exceeds the bounds of the string.
A compound operand that defines a character string that does not
completely fall within the bounds of the base character
string was referenced.
A substring with position (P) e1 and length (L) e1 does not meet the
following constraint (n is the length of the base string):
<DL>
