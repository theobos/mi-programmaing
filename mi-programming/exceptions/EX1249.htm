</I>
<P>An attempt was made to create an MI object that requires the
execution of a User Defined Function but the attempt failed because
there is no control block for shared derivation.  This implies
that no shared derivation environment has been initialized.
<P>In order for a User Defined Function to be run by the machine, a
shared derivation environment is required. The term shared derivation
environment refers to the information
needed by the machine to support the synchronization of
processing and the interchange of data between the parent thread and
child thread.
