<h1>Array Index Operations</h1>
Single dimensioned arrays are supported.  The <A HREF="instructions/CAI.htm">CAI</A> (Compute Array
Index) instruction can be used to reduce the subscript value of a
multidimensional array to a single index value.  This single
index value can be used to address a single dimensioned array.
<P>
Following is an example of the use of the <A HREF="instructions/CAI.htm">CAI</A> instruction.
Assume that in a high-level language a three-dimensional array is
declared with five elements in the first dimension, four in the
second, and three in the third.
<PRE>  DCL  A(5,4,3)
</PRE>This is equivalent to a declare of a single dimension array of 60
elements.
<PRE>  DCL  A(60)
</PRE>If A(I,J,K) is to be located, where I=4, J=2, and K=3, the
instructions that would be used are:
<PRE>  CAI  X,I,J,5   X=4+(2-1)*5 = 9
  CAI  X,X,K,20  X=9+(3-1)*20 = 49
</PRE><P>A reference to A(X) locates the 49th element of the array.
